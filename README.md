# HexagonLoadingView
This is a library which was influenced by the loading/prograss bar in Overwatch.

# Usage
If you want to use this, you can simple copy the class [HexagonLoadingView](https://github.com/Agraphie/hexagonloadingview/blob/master/library/src/main/java/de/clemenskeppler/hexagonloadingview/HexagonLoadingView.java)
to your project, include it in your XML file and call it a day.

If you want more fine grained control over the animations, colors and durations, just take a closer look at that class.
For example, if you want the whole animation to be faster, just change the variable ```APPEARANCE_SPEED_COEFFICIENT``` to a lower number.

# Help
Any help to improve the animations and make them smoother is appreciated.
